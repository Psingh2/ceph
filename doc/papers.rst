Additional Features
-----------------------
Ceph integrates with any existing system.  It also improves Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between third parties.  Its systems feature maximum security protocols. 
Its unified data distribution platform ensures that no space is wasted or underutilized no matter what storage clusters are used.    Metadata servers can be added into the cluster on an 
as-needed basis, and the load is automatically balanced.   These servers do not store any data locally; instead it is all stored on the object storage nodes resulting in optimum performance.
